- Her father tries to check if there was any breathing but there was no signs of life

- Phoned the police

- Police found unexplained injuries on her body

# Forensic Offices for Recon

- Scene Examination

- Photographs

- Working a path

- Pathologist defined the cause of death to be a result of a large cut on her neck

- Injuries were not caused by herself

- Caused by another person

- Indicates murder

# Investigation Started by Forensic Team

- Quite a bit of damage found in bedroom 

- Blood on light switches, cup board doors

- Scene indicated heavy struggle

- Potentially a fight over access to the room

- Alicia's body swabbed fo trace evidence

- This is DNA that is transferred through contact, so essentially the skin cells have been transferred to the body

- Hairs & Fibers collected from other areas of exposed skin & from the dressing gown

- Samples sent to esr for processing

- Alicia's ex-partner Carl Eddy arrived at scene & provided futher information 
`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
- He had received a text message from Alicia's phone referring about a stalker following her at her workplace

- 3 texts sent from her phone that morning all about a stalker

- No sign of forced entry

- Alicia was wearing a dressing gown - not a surprised intruder

- Dog would have barked if there was a stranger - NOT a stranger

- Access to the premises was through a driveway to the orchard area through the back gate that lead in the vegetable garden and then around the corner of the house to the unit

- Back yard locked down for scene examination

- It was very hot | Worst condition for degradation of DNA - Sunlight

- Sunlight + Moisture (Rain) - Worst

- Checked disturances in dust, dirt, on window

- Exit Route? Small depression on top of a compost heap beneath the fence

- Swabs collect cell evidence that may be present (Fence Examine)

- Even if blood is not visible, there may be a possiblity of finding a depleted print

- If someone touches a surface with blood stained hands, they will be leaving less and less blood each time --> Washed in methanol to stabilize print --> Amido black applied (Die + Protein in blood = Prints more visible)

- Above process done in crime scene revealed hand smudge but not enough for fingerprint analysis

- Key evidence: Fingerprint on the door knob (Visible with naked eye)
`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
- Collected small blood amt with swab -- if DNA could identify blood was of Alicia, the print culd identify the murdered

- Knife used for crime & Alicia's cell phone missing

- ANalysis of mobile text msg revealed that the msgs were sent from different locations -- Person sending msg was moving -- deterined from cell tower used

- Messages not sent by Alicia

- Style of texting mismatch - Incorrect Spelling & Abbreviations

- Blood from door knob did belong to ALicia - Proved from ESR

- Door removed from Alicia's room (crime scene) to the lab for investigation

- Technique: Fuming Cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) --> Used to get unseen prints on the door visible

- Prints then dusted & Lifted --> HIgh amt of fingerprint patterning found on bedroom door

- Usable prints marked by arrows & Lifted

- Visual Analysis showed all those prints were similar

- Carl Eddy was giving all informations one after the other to the police by himself

- He was very keen to showing Alicia's text on his phone

- He said he was a very good guy and he had no issues with women but reports clarified that he was involved in domestic violence

- Carl said that he had taken sleeping pills & was sleeping at the time of the incident | On investigating it was found 30/30 pills were present -- he had taken none | He was awake at that time as his phone was monitored to be awake
